Hello teachers,
I tried to upload my changes on GitHub and again I had a huge problem and could not submit my work. 
I have a sketch file in my folder, which makes it not possible to upload the work. I will try to figure out how I can 
upload it as soon as possible. I am really sorry. Just so you know I changed all my image names. 
I would appreciate it if you would give me feedback on my website anyway. 
Thanks a lot,
Have a nice break
Anni


Dear Anni,
the only file that has changed is the README.md. None of your website files are changed. So I can't give you feedback on your new version of your website
