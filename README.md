Hello teachers,
I tried to upload my work on GitHub and I thought I did, but when I wanted to send it in 
the day of the deadline and I asked one of my friends to check the link for me, there was no work 
provided. It did say that I created the account and that I had been active but somehow we could not
see my work. So I deleted the file and created a new one. By the time my computer was done loading
the link on blackboard was gone. I am really sorry. I send you the work through email. I hope this
is not a criteria to make me fail. I really put a lot of effort in this. And it is also available on
GitHub now, we managed to upload it. 
Anyway I hope this smal problem will effect my grading. 
Have nice holidays!
